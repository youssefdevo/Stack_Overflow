# Stack Overflow Simulation

This project is a Java-based simulation of the Stack Overflow platform, allowing users to ask questions, provide answers, comment, vote, and interact with various elements of a Q&A system. It serves as a demonstration of object-oriented programming principles and data structures in Java.

## Features

- **Users**: Create and manage users who can participate in the platform.
- **Questions**: Ask questions with titles, descriptions, and associated tags.
- **Answers**: Provide answers to questions, which can be upvoted or downvoted.
- **Comments**: Add comments to questions and answers.
- **Voting**: Upvote or downvote questions and answers.
- **Tags**: Categorize questions with tags for better organization.


## Example Usage
The StackOverflowDemo class demonstrates how to use the platform to:

- Create users
- Ask questions
- Add comments and tags
- Vote on questions and answers
- Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

## Concepts Demonstrated
**Object-Oriented Programming(OOP):**
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
  
**Interfaces:**
- Implementing Commentable and Votable for modular design

**Data Structures:**
- Managing users, questions, answers, and votes using collections
